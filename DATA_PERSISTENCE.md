# Data Persistence Guide

## ✅ YES - Your Data Will Persist!

When you shut down your laptop and restart, **all your records will still be there** when you run the application again.

## How Data is Stored

### 1. **Frontend Data (IndexedDB)**
- **Location**: Stored in your browser's IndexedDB
- **Database Name**: `FinancialCalculatorDB`
- **What's stored**: 
  - Transactions
  - Expenses
  - Savings
  - Goals
  - Reminders
  - Budgets
  - Files/Attachments
  - Currency Settings

**Persistence**: ✅ Persists across:
- Browser restarts
- Laptop shutdowns/restarts
- Docker container restarts
- Application restarts

**⚠️ Important Notes**:
- Data is stored **per browser** (Chrome, Firefox, Safari each have separate data)
- Data is stored **per computer** (not synced across devices)
- If you clear browser data, you'll lose the data

### 2. **Backend Data (Excel Files)**
- **Location**: `./backend/data/` and `./backend/budget_data.xlsx`
- **What's stored**: Backend transaction data (if using Excel sync)

**Persistence**: ✅ Persists because:
- Docker volumes are mapped to your local filesystem
- Files are stored on your laptop's hard drive
- Data survives Docker container restarts
- Data survives laptop shutdowns

## What Happens When You:

### ✅ Shut Down Laptop → Restart
**Result**: All data is preserved!
- IndexedDB data remains in browser
- Excel files remain on disk
- Just run `docker-compose up` again

### ✅ Stop Docker Containers
**Result**: All data is preserved!
- Data is stored outside containers
- Restart with `docker-compose up`

### ✅ Restart Docker Containers
**Result**: All data is preserved!
- Volumes persist data
- IndexedDB persists in browser

### ✅ Clear Browser Data
**Result**: Data is automatically restored!
- IndexedDB will be cleared
- **BUT**: On next app startup, data is automatically restored from backend Excel files
- Your data is safe! 🎉

### ⚠️ Delete Project Folder
**Result**: All data is lost!
- Both IndexedDB and Excel files would be lost

## Backup Recommendations

### Option 1: Export Data Regularly
Use the **Data Export** feature in the app:
1. Click "Export" in the header
2. Select all data types
3. Export to Excel or PDF
4. Save to cloud storage (Google Drive, iCloud, etc.)

### Option 2: Backup Project Folder
```bash
# Copy the entire project folder
cp -r /Users/ketharnathsivavenkatesan/Desktop/Github /path/to/backup/
```

### Option 3: Backup Backend Data
```bash
# Copy backend data folder
cp -r backend/data /path/to/backup/
cp backend/budget_data.xlsx /path/to/backup/
```

## Quick Test

To verify data persistence:
1. Add a test expense/transaction
2. Shut down Docker: `docker-compose down`
3. Restart Docker: `docker-compose up -d`
4. Open http://localhost:3000
5. ✅ Your test data should still be there!

## Summary

**Your data is safe!** It persists across:
- ✅ Laptop shutdowns
- ✅ Docker restarts
- ✅ Application restarts
- ✅ Browser restarts
- ✅ **Browser data clearing** (automatically restored from backend!)

**How it works**:
1. All data is automatically synced to backend Excel files
2. If browser data is cleared, data is restored on next startup
3. Data is stored in both IndexedDB (fast) and Excel files (persistent)

**Just remember**:
- Don't delete the project folder
- Export regularly for extra safety
- **You can safely clear browser data - it will be restored!** 🎉
